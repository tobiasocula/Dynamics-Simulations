### Simple physics simulation experiments

Check out full documentation + explanations here:


This repository is all about me having fun experimenting with building a relatively simple physics simulation.

This repository has two implementations: one for simulating an object that follows a two dimensional curve $(t,f(t))$ for some real valued function $f$, being affected by gravity, and one for simulating an object that lies on a surface in 3D given a surface $(x,y,f(x,y))$.
